My name is Jacob Watkiss, a second year MPhys student working under Dr Richard Beanland over the summer of 2024, and, whilst I am the author of this repositry, I am not the original
author of the program "Felix" (which can be found here: https://github.com/WarwickMicroscopy/Felix).
It is my job to translate Felix from FORTRAN to Python; my understanding of the science is limited, and I am new to coding in a more professional context (as opposed to programming assignments
for courses which are all done exclusively in IDEs and rarely interract with other files, let alone other programs). I expect there to be some flaws, redundancies or pieces of the code that
could be done in a more efficient way, but I have commented the code extensively, so these should hopefully be easy to tackle in the future, whether by myself or future editors.

At the time of writing, I have converted the following modules/programs from FORTRAN into Python:
read_cif_mod
ReciprocalLattices (a function found within Crystallography_mod)


If you need to contact me for whatever reason (although Dr Beanland would be the more sensible choice), I can be reached at jacob.g.watkiss@gmail.com.
