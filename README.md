My name is Jacob Watkiss, a second year MPhys student working under Dr Richard Beanland over the summer of 2024, and, whilst I am the author of this repositry, I am not the original
author of the program "Felix" (which can be found here: https://github.com/WarwickMicroscopy/Felix).
It is my job to translate Felix from FORTRAN to Python; my understanding of the science is limited, and I am new to coding in a more professional context (as opposed to programming assignments
for courses which are all done exclusively in IDEs and rarely interract with other files, let alone other programs). I expect there to be some flaws, redundancies or pieces of the code that
could be done in a more efficient way, but I have commented the code extensively, so these should hopefully be easy to tackle in the future, whether by myself or future editors.

This project is now being completed by myself and Sabe - I will allow him to write about himself so as not to reveal anything he is not comfortable sharing. He has been very helpful, completing more modules/functions whilst I have been more focused on testing/debugging exisiting files. At the time of writing, he has completed the following: image_initialisation_mod, ug_matrix_mod and set_scatter_factors_mod. I need to integrate these into the main code (such as felixrefine) and test it all as a full program - Felix.

If you need to contact me for whatever reason (although Dr Beanland would be the more sensible choice), I can be reached at jacob.g.watkiss@gmail.com.



I have finished working on Felix as of 29/08/24. At this point, I have completed all functions required to work felixrefine up to and including HKLMake. I had intended to complete more, but did not have time. I have done my best to document as much as possible and every function is commented thoroughly so it should be easy to pick up where I left off. To my knowledge, Dr Beanland will be taking over to finish this project and so should be the point of contact for the future, however I will leave my email here so that if there are any queries you can find me still. I hope that this code treats you well.

-Jacob
